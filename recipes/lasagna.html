        <h2>How to Reheat Lasagna</h2>
        <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you are in a pinch short
            on time, and be aware that it will change the texture of noodles. The best
            way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil
            and bake at 350 degree F for about half an hour, or until it's reheated through
            and the sauce is bubbly.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Freeze Lasagna</h2>
        <p>If you're planning to freeze lasagna, its best to cook it in a foil baking dish.
            Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least one layer
            of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminium foil to prevent freezer burn. Freeze upto
            three months.
        </p>
        <h3> How to Reheat Frozen Lasagna</h3>
        <p> Thaw the frozen in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating instructions 
            above. If you don't have time to thaw in the fridge, you can reheat it from frozen-- just
            make sure to add few minutes to cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.
